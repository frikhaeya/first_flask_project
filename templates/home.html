            A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to 
            those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
